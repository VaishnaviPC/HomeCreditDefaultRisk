# Home Credit Default Risk

**Problem Statement :** 

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories and are often taken advantage of by untrustworthy people.For a safe and positive loan experience Home Credit makes use of alternative data including telco and transaction details in order to predict client’s repayment capabilities.
Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

**Solution :**

Building a model to predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan, so that loan sanctioning is done only for the applicants who are likely to repay the loan.

**Mapping to a Machine Learning Problem:**

Since we have two classes in the target label, we will pose this problem as a Binary classification problem.

**Work Flow process as follows:**
1) Data Exploration
2) Data Cleaning and Fixing Process
3) Data Preparation
4) Experimenting Top best performing algorithms
5) Building a Voting Classifier
6) Classification Report
