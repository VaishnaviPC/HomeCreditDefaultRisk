# HomeCreditDefaultRisk

**Problem Statement :** 

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories and are often taken advantage of by untrustworthy people.For a safe and positive loan experience Home Credit makes use of alternative data including telco and transaction details in order to predict clientâ€™s repayment capabilities.
Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

**Solution :**

Building a model to predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan, so that loan sanctioning is done only for the applicants who are likely to repay the loan.
**Mapping to a Machine Learning Problem:**

Since we have two classes in the target label, we will pose this problem as a Binary classification problem.

**Work Flow process as follows:**
1) Data Exploration
2) Data Cleaning and Fixing Process
3) Data Preparation
4) Experimenting Top best performing algorithms
5) Building a Voting Classifier
6) Classification Report
